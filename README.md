About this code:
- For research purpose only. 
- For beginners who are trying to use OpenCV's functions for stereo camera calibration.
- Including 2 main files "140405 camera calibration(c++)Dlg.h" and "140405 camera calibration(c++)Dlg.cpp".
- In default, the code can be opened using Visual Studio 2013, but other Visual Studio versions are alright
  with the .h and .cpp files. 
- Chessboard, symmetric circle grid, and asymmetric circle grid in different sizes can be used.
- Able to calibration one view (2 images) and multiple views.
- Calibration results are saved to 2 text files (one for left, one for right image) with intrinsic, 
  distortion, rotation, projection, and perspective transformation (Q) matrices.
